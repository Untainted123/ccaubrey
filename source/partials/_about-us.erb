        <h2>What is a Pentecostal Church?</h2>
        <p class='lead'>
          A Truly Pentecostal Church:
          <ul class='list-unstyled'>
            <li>Stands upon the Bible as the divinely-inspired Word of God and the baseline authority for teachings about Him</li>
            <li>Proclaims the same message of salvation preached on the Day of Pentecost (the birth day of the original church) as recorded in Acts 2:38</li>
            <li>Believes in and encourages expressive worship and liberty in the Holy Ghost</li>
            <li>Teaches and practices prayer as the only way to truly know God and receive His blessings, whether spiritual, financial or physical</li>
            <li>Witnesses deliverance from alcoholism, smoking, and addictions of every kind</li>
            <li>Focuses on living the good life through a solid relationship with Jesus Christ Himself!</li>
          </ul>

      <p class="lead">We Pray Together Out Loud</p>
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "They lifted up their voice to God with one accord..." (Acts 4:24).
    </p>
        
    <p class="lead">We Lift Our Hands In Praise
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD" (Psalm 134:2).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">We Sing With All Our Hearts
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise" (Psalm 98:4).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">We Play Musical Instruments
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "...and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments..."(II Samuel 6:5).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">We Clap and Shout Unto God
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "...O clap your hands all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph" (Psalm 47:1).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">We Dance in the Spirit
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "...Praise Him with the timbrel and dance: praise Him with stringed instruments and organs" (Psalm 150:4).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">We Testify Publicly
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee" (Psalm 22:22).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">We Anoint With Oil for Divine Healing
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the LORD" (James 5:14).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">We Allow the Operation of the Spiritual Gifts
    </p>
    <p>Because in the Bible we read, "When ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation..." (I Corinthians 14:26).
    </p>
